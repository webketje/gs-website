          <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
          <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
          <p>Like most website operators, www.get-simple.info collects
            non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and
            servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
            preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
            www.get-simple.info's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
            information is to better understand how www.get-simple.info's visitors use its
            website. From time to time, www.get-simple.info may release
            non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a
            report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
          <p>www.get-simple.info also collects potentially personally-identifying
            information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. get-simple.info does not
            use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose
            such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and
            discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>
          <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
          <p>Certain visitors to www.get-simple.info websites choose to interact with
            www.get-simple.info in ways that require www.get-simple.info to gather
            personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that
            www.get-simple.info gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For
            example, we ask visitors who use our forums to provide a username and email
            address. In each case, www.get-simple.info collects such information only
            insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's
            interaction with www.get-simple.info. www.get-simple.info does not disclose
            personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors
            can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the
            caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related
            activities.</p>
          <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
          <p>www.get-simple.info may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to
            its websites. For instance, www.get-simple.info may reveal how many downloads
            a particular version got, or say which plugins are most popular based on
            checks from www.get-simple.info/api/, a web service used by
            www.get-simple.info installations to check for new versions of GetSimple and
            plugins. However, www.get-simple.info does not disclose personally-identifying
            information other than as described below.</p>
          <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
          <p>www.get-simple.info discloses potentially personally-identifying and
            personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
            contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
            information in order to process it on www.get-simple.info's behalf or to
            provide services available at www.get-simple.info's websites, and (ii) that
            have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors
            and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by
            using www.get-simple.info's websites, you consent to the transfer of such
            information to them. www.get-simple.info will not rent or sell potentially
            personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other
            than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described
            above, www.get-simple.info discloses potentially personally-identifying and
            personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when
            www.get-simple.info believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably
            necessary to protect the property or rights of www.get-simple.info, third
            parties, or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a
            www.get-simple.info website and have supplied your email address,
            www.get-simple.info may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new
            features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going
            on with www.get-simple.info and our products. We primarily use our forum to
            communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email
            to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via
            one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order
            to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other
            users. www.get-simple.info takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect
            against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of
            potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
          <h3>Cookies</h3>
          <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's
            computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the
            visitor returns. www.get-simple.info uses cookies to help www.get-simple.info
            identify and track visitors, their usage of www.get-simple.info website, and

            to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse
            cookies before using www.get-simple.info's websites, with the drawback that
            certain features of www.get-simple.info's websites may not function properly
            without the aid of cookies.</p>
          <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
          <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, www.get-simple.info may change
            its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in www.get-simple.info's sole
            discretion. www.get-simple.info encourages visitors to frequently check this
            page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site
            after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of
