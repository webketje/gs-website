            <li><strong>XML Based</strong><br>
              We don't use mySQL to store our information, but instead depend the
              simplicity of XML. By utilizing XML, we are able stay away from introducing
              an extra layer of slowness and complexity associated with connecting to a
              mySQL database. Because GetSimple was built specifically for the small-site
              market, we feel this is the absolutely best option for data storage.</li>
            <li><strong>You can "Undo" Almost Everything</strong><br>
              This feature was based off an eye-opening <a
                href="https://www.alistapart.com/articles/neveruseawarning">AListApart</a>
              article explaining how
              warning messages never work as planned. Because of this, we've included
              "undo" into almost every action you can take on the site, giving you
              peace-of-mind for when you make those inevitable stupid mistakes.</li>
          
            <li><strong>Easy to Learn UI</strong><br>
              The top priority when designing our user-interface was to make it the best
              in it's class. We had the luxury of trying and testing all the competing
              management systems before designing ours, so we took the best out of each
              one - then refined it.</li>
          
            <li><strong>Simple Installation</strong><br>
              The total time in setting up a website took a total of 5 minutes, from
              starting the FTP to finishing the setup procedure.</li>
          
            <li><strong>Simple Theme Customization</strong><br>
              We have how to documents that show you how to create a custom theme. Our
              goal was not to bloat our software with hundreds of little-used theme
              functions, but to offer more than enough to allow for a fully customized
              theme.</li>
          
            <li><strong>Designed For the Small-Site Market</strong><br>
              This is one of the reasons GetSimple uses XML rather than a robust database
              such as mySQL. For most small businesses, their only real need is to be able
              to easily update their site without the need of a ton of extraneous rarely
              used features. GetSimple's goal is to manage small websites efficiently and
              effectively.</li>
